# Lotka-Volterra simulation

A simulation in which packs of predators, herds of prey, and colonies
of invasive species interact according to the rules outlined at
[rules.html](/rules.html).
While inspired by the Lotka-Volterra equations for modeling predator-prey
dynamics, it is not a direct representation of those differential
equations.

This project is made under the guidance of, and graciously sponsored by, the
[RiskEcon Lab at NYU](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/riskeconlab/).


## Rules
