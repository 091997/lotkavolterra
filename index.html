        <h2>The Lotka-Volterra Model</h2>

        <p>
          In nature, predator and prey populations interact constantly.
          Their competitive interactions are described by mathematical
          models that predict the dynamics of population ecology.
          Perhaps the most seminal of these models is the
          <em>Lotka-Volterra</em> model
          (Lotka 1910, 1920, 1925; Volterra 1926).
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic Lotka-Volterra model is comprised of a coupled pair
          of fundamental equations that describe interactions,
          typically between two competing species,
          within a given system or setting
          (e.g. an ecology, an economy).
          In the classic predator-prey setting of Lotka-Volterra,
          given ample food,
          the prey population grows exponentially in isolation,
          but is constrained by encountering predators.
          Conversely, the predator population,
          relying upon prey for food,
          declines exponentially in the absence of sufficient prey;
          such decline is offset by encountering a supply of
          prey species.
          The coupled interaction of these two equations results in a
          cyclically fluctuating
          &ldquo;growth and decline&rdquo;
          dynamic that can continue indefinitely,
          under certain conditions,
          i.e. <em>homeostasis</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past century or so since first proposed by
          mathematician Alfred J. Lotka
          (based upon the logistic equation derived in 1825 by
          mathematician Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois Verhulst for describing
          the role of carrying capacity and resources in population
          dynamics),
          Lotka-Volterra has had wide-ranging application in describing
          the dynamics between many populations in nature
          (e.g. interdependencies between moose and wolf populations on
          Isle Royale in Lake Superior).
          In addition to ecology, the general framework has been
          applied to numerous other scientific fields
          and disciplines, including economics, resource competition,
          demography, population dynamics, speciation and epidemiology.

        <h2>The Simulation</h2>

        <p>
          We have conducted a simple computational experiment
          to demonstrate how Lotka-Volterra type models apply
          to the study of population dynamics.
          This illustrative computational experiment applies a
          predator-prey model to attendees at the luncheon to
          simulate how competitive interactions between species may
          influence relative population growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each attendee has been randomly (and anonymously) assigned to
          be one of three populations,
          each of which has been observed in or near
          <a href="http://blackrockforest.org/">Black Rock Forest</a>:
          Eastern coyote (predator), wild turkey (prey), or
          Eurasian boar (invasive species).
          The Eurasian boar is generally considered to
          be an encroaching invasive species.
          Invasive species destabilize the ecosystem,
          by competing with native species for resources.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Over time, the population assigned to your location will
          interact with two adjacent populations,
          according to rules inspired by the Lotka-Volterra framework.
          Each &ldquo;bubble&rdquo;
          expands and contracts with the respective
          growth and decline of the population of its assigned species.
          Note: the computer simulation will periodically restart
          (after a <em>trial</em> of approximately 50 iterations),
          with a different final outcome likely to occur at the end
          of each trial.

          In essence, each table represents an ecosystem comprised of
          local habitats, where species engage and interact by
          competing for local resources.
          Depending upon the initially assigned conditions
          (i.e. adjacent locations of competing species),
          and some degree of ongoing uncertainty,
          some ecosystems may survive or even thrive for many
          generations.
          However, other ecosystems may collapse due to inherently
          unstable conditions.
