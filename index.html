        <p>
          Everyone knows that predator and prey populations change
          in response to each other.
          Scientists have developed models to show what happens to these
          populations over time, including one called Lotka-Volterra.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Lotka-Volterra model is just two simple equations,
          based on equally simple assumptions  that do not factor
          in overpopulation or other natural complexities.
          The prey population, given ample food,
          grows exponentially on its own,
          but is negatively affected by encountering predators.
          The predator population, relying on prey for food,
          declines exponentially on its own,
          but is positively affected by encountering prey.
          This creates a cycle that can continue indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lotka-Volterra has been useful in describing some real natural
          populations, such as moose and wolves in Isle Royale National
          Park in Lake Superior.
          It also has surprising applications in other areas,
          such as economics, speciation, resource competition,
          and epidemiology.

        <h2 class="page-title">The Simulation</h2>

        <p>
          We developed a thought exercise to show how models can be
          used in the real world:
          a computer simulation that applies a predator-prey
          model to the guests at this luncheon.
          You will see it running on a screen at times during the event.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each guest has been randomly assigned to be one of
          three populations, all of which exist in
          <a href="http://blackrockforest.org/">Black Rock Forest</a>:
          Eastern coyotes, wild turkeys, or Eurasian boars.
          Eurasian boars are an invasive species, which, as in nature,
          throws a monkey wrench into the works by competing with
          native species for resources.
        </p>

        <div class="animal-photos">
          <img class="predator" src="/static/images/EasternCoyote.jpg">
          <img class="prey" src="/static/images/WildTurkey.jpg">
          <img class="invasive" src="/static/images/EurasianBoar.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
          Over time, even as you eat your lunch,
          the population you represent will be interacting
          with the two populations sitting next to you,
          according to rules inspired by the Lotka-Volterra
          model but with some added complexities.
          You can see your bubble on the screen grow or shrink
          as your population responds to these interactions.
          A population will go extinct if it gets too small
          or gets too big and explodes.
          Fortunately, you yourself will not explode.
        </p>

          lotkavolterra.launchSimulation({
            generations: 40,
            repeat: true,
            simulation: "homepage.json"
          });
        </script>

        <p>
          If you're lucky, your table will survive for many generations,
          the populations keeping one another in check.
          But some tables will be wiped out quickly from an
          imbalanced dynamic.
          Extinction may be forever in the real world, but here,
          the simulation periodically starts over,
          and the outcome may be different each time.
