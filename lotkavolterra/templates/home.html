  <div class="text">
    <p>
      Everyone knows that predator and prey populations change
      in response to each other.
      Scientists have developed models to show what happens to these
      populations over time, including one called Lotka-Volterra.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lotka-Volterra model is just two simple equations,
      based on equally simple assumptions  that do not factor
      in overpopulation or other natural complexities.
      The prey population, given ample food, grows exponentially on its own,
      but is negatively affected by encountering predators.
      The predator population, relying on prey for food,
      declines exponentially on its own,
      but is positively affected by encountering prey.
      This creates a cycle that can continue indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lotka-Volterra has been useful in describing some real natural
      populations, such as moose and wolves in Isle Royale National
      Park in Lake Superior.
      It also has surprising applications in other areas,
      such as economics, speciation, resource competition,
      and epidemiology.

	<h2 class="page-title">The Simulation</h2>

  <div class="text">
    <p>
      We developed a thought exercise to show how models can be used in
      the real world: a computer simulation that applies a predator-prey
      model to the guests at this luncheon. You will see it running on a
      screen at times during the event.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each guest has been randomly assigned to be one of three populations,
      all of which exist in Black Rock Forest: Eastern coyotes, wild
      turkeys, or Eurasian boars.
      Eurasian boars are an invasive species, which, as in nature,
      throws a monkey wrench into the works by competing with
      native species for resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, even as you eat your lunch, the population you represent
      will be interacting with the two populations sitting next to you,
      according to rules inspired by the Lotka-Volterra model but with
      some added complexities.
      You can see your bubble on the screen grow or shrink
      as your population responds to these interactions.
      A population will go extinct if it gets too small or gets too
      big and explodes.
      Fortunately, you yourself will not explode.
    </p>

    <p>
      If youâ€™re lucky, your table will survive for many generations,
      the populations keeping one another in check.
      But some tables will be wiped out quickly from an imbalanced dynamic.
      Extinction may be forever in the real world, but here,
      the simulation periodically starts over,
      and the outcome may be different each time.
